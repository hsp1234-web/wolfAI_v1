# Wolf AI V2.2 Backend Environment Variables Example

# 1. Google API Key (Gemini API Key or other relevant Google Cloud API keys)
#    This key is read at application startup from the environment variable COLAB_GOOGLE_API_KEY.
#    If deployed in Colab, this should be set in Colab's "Secrets" manager with the name COLAB_GOOGLE_API_KEY.
# COLAB_GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"

# 2. Google Service Account Key (JSON content or path to JSON file)
#    This is required for Google Drive integration if not using user OAuth.
#    If providing the path to the JSON file:
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service_account.json"
#    Alternatively, the content of the service account JSON can be provided through a specific mechanism
#    if the COLAB_GOOGLE_API_KEY itself is the JSON string (requires parsing in the app).
#    You can also provide the JSON content directly via GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_CONTENT
# GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_CONTENT='{"type": "service_account", ...}'
